# Etherscan Toggle

Created by [Backseats](https://twitter.com/backseats_eth)

A simple Chrome extension to toggle through various Etherscan flavors for `/address` and `/token` URLs.

Clicking the extension will toggle the URL from `https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa32b933b8b8701a3baf6ba0166a4107e0b6c00cd` to `https://bscscan.com/address/0xa32b933b8b8701a3baf6ba0166a4107e0b6c00cd`, then to Blast, then back around to ETH Mainnet.

Supported:

```
